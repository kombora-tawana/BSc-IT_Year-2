## Types of cloud computing

***Infrastructure as a service*** [IaaS](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-iaas)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offers on-demand access to IT infrastructure services, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. It provides the highest level of control over your IT resources and most closely resembles traditional on-premises IT resources.

***Platform as a service*** [PaaS](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-paas)

Platform as a service (PaaS) offers all the hardware and software resources needed for cloud application development. With PaaS, companies can focus fully on application development without the burden of managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

***Software as a service (SaaS)***

Software as a service (SaaS) delivers a full application stack as a service, from underlying infrastructure to maintenance and updates to the app software itself. A SaaS solution is often an end-user application, where both the service and the infrastructure is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.
