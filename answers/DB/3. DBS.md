A functional dependency in a relational database is a connection between two characteristics (or columns) where the value of one attribute affects the value of the other. This idea is crucial for database normalization, which entails arranging a table's attributes to get rid of duplication and other potential problems. 2 or more dependent

Transitive Dependency: In a transitive dependency, one attribute determines another indirectly through a third attribute. For example, consider the following table:
| Customer Name | Street Address | City | State |
|          |          |          |      |       |
|          |          |          |      |       |
|          |          |          |      |       |
	

3 or more dependent 

The column "Customer Name" in this table determines the "Street Address," and the "Street Address" determines the "City" and "State." This is a transitive dependency because "Customer Name" is indirectly dependent on "City" and "State" through "Street Address."

We would need to separate this data into two tables—one for customer information and one for address information—in order to standardize it. By doing this, the transitive dependency would be removed and each table's primary key would be unique.

A non-key attribute that depends on the complete main key, rather than only a portion of it, is referred to as having a full functional dependency. For example, consider the following table:

|Student ID|	Course| 	Grade|
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
|          |          |          |
		
		


The primary key in this table is "Student ID"; the non-key attributes "Course" and "Grade" are not keys. We have a partial dependency if "Grade" depends solely on "Course" and not on the "Student ID." However, if "Grade" is reliant on both "Student ID" and "Course," we have a complete functional dependency.

For instance, imagine that each student is only permitted to enroll in a course once, making each "Student ID" and "Course" combination distinct. As a result, "Grade" would be entirely reliant on the two characteristics. If this data were to be normalized, it would be divided into two separate tables: one for student information and one for course information, with a third table for grades that uses the "Student ID" and "Course" characteristics as a composite primary key.

A view will stop working if one of the tables it depends on is dropped. This is due to the fact that a view is a virtual table built from the underlying tables, and any changes to those tables may have an impact on the view.

The database system will produce an error indicating that the view cannot be found or that it is invalid if the view is accessed after the underlying table has been dropped. Due to its dependence on the missing table, the view will not be kept.

The view will need to be changed or removed in order to fix this problem. The view can simply be dropped if it is no longer required. The view will need to be changed to either remove the reference to the missing table or to replace it with a valid table if it is still required. All of the underlying tables must exist for the view to be legitimate if it depends on more than one table.

Note that views are stored in the database as metadata rather than as actual physical tables. Dropping a table that a view uses won't change the content of the other tables' actual data, but it will change how those tables may be accessed by the view.

Popular open-source software framework Hadoop is used to store and handle massive distributed data collections. It is made to handle huge data workloads that conventional relational database management systems are unable to handle efficiently. Here are some explanations for why Hadoop is a superior option for large data pre-processing than other software programs like SPSS:

Hadoop is a great option for businesses working with big volumes of data because of its high scalability and capacity to manage petabytes of data. On the other hand, SPSS is built for smaller data sets and could have trouble with large amounts of data.
Hadoop processes big data sets over a number of devices using a distributed file system (HDFS) and a distributed computation architecture (MapReduce). Compared to SPSS, which normally operates on a single machine, this enables quicker processing times and more fault tolerance.


Cost-effectiveness: Hadoop is open-source and free to use, which makes it a cost-effective solution for big data processing. SPSS, on the other hand, requires a license fee, which can be a barrier for smaller organizations or those with limited budgets.
Flexibility: Hadoop supports a wide range of data formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. This makes it easier to work with diverse data sets that may not fit neatly into a traditional relational database. SPSS, on the other hand, is primarily designed for structured data and may struggle with other data formats. 
Hadoop is very adaptable and can be expanded with new tools and libraries to fulfill specialized business requirements. On the other hand, SPSS is a closed system that might be difficult to extend.
In conclusion, because of its scalability, distributed processing, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and customizability, Hadoop is a superior option than SPSS for large data pre-processing. Hadoop is better suited for big data workloads that demand processing and analysis of large-scale distributed data sets, whereas SPSS may be a solid option for smaller data sets or specialised analytical tasks.

An entity set can be defined as a collection of related items or ideas that are significant in a particular context. Students, lecturers, courses, modules, and departments are all significant groups of objects or concepts that are crucial to the operation of the Somhlolo Graduate Institute. Each of these collections can be viewed as an entity set and represented as a database table.

•	Students: It refers to the group of students enrolled in Somhlolo Graduate Institute.
•	Lecturers: It refers to the group of teachers or lecturers who teach courses in the institute.
•	Courses: It refers to the group of courses offered by the institute in Information Technology and Business management.
•	Modules: It refers to the individual sections or components of each course.
•	Departments: It refers to the different departments in the institute that offer courses.

1.	Students entity set:
•	Attributes: Student ID, Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Contact Details (Phone Number, Email Address), Address, Nationality, Enrollment Date
•	Primary key: Student ID
2.	Lecturers entity set:
•	Attributes: Lecturer ID, Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Contact Details (Phone Number, Email Address), Address, Nationality, Department ID
•	Primary key: Lecturer ID
3.	Courses entity set:
•	Attributes: Course ID, Course Name, Course Description, Department ID
•	Primary key: Course ID
4.	Modules entity set:
•	Attributes: Module ID, Module Name, Module Description, Course ID, Lecturer ID
•	Primary key: Module ID
5.	Departments entity set:
•	Attributes: Department ID, Department Name, Department Head (Lecturer ID), Department Description
•	Primary key: Department ID


Each entity set in the described scenario has unique attributes that specify its qualities. Students, for instance, have characteristics like name, ID, date of birth, and contact information. Similar properties exist for courses, including name, ID, and description. In addition, a main key is used to uniquely identify each entity in each group of entities. For instance, the student ID serves as the main key for the students entity collection.
