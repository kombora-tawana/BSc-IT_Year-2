# Year 2 Assignments

*Hello.*

My name is Tawana and the year is 2023.

I am a 2nd year student at Richfield College.

I made this repository with the intent of documenting my learning journey/ process but also to learn 'out in the open'. I have this hypothesis that having to post my work like this will force me to do it.

Why?

Because anyone can view my profile and subsequently the public repos. It would be awful to have people come here to see what I did in my 2nd year only to be met with an unfinished repo, incomplete assignments or a repo that is only updated when everything is complete.
***
My degree is titled `'Bachelor of Science in Information Technology'.`

Meaning I'm studying information but specifically the technology we use to interact with information.

Studying information technology makes me feel a sense of responsibility.

\- The responsibility entails being competent at *gathering*, *filtering*, *processing* and *sharing* information.
